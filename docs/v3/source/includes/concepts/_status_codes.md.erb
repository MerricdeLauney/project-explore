## Status Codes

Cloud Foundry V3 API uses a subset of HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that can potentially be fixed by correcting the request, and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error on the server side.
