## Filters

Endpoints which return lists of resources also support filtering the returned resources using query parameters. Each
resource's list endpoint documents the allowed filters for that endpoint. For details about the syntax of query parameters
in general, see [query parameters](#query-parameters).

#### Examples

##### **Single value request**
`GET /v3/apps?names=the_name`

This will return all apps with name `the_name`.

##### **Multiple value request**
`GET /v3/apps?names=first_name,second_name`

This will return all apps with name `the_name` OR `second_name`.

In the case of audit events, multiple timestamps can be requested, which will return all audit
events that occurred at those timestamps. In the following request, all audit events that occurred
New Year's just before midnight and July 4th at noon will be returned:

`GET /v3/audit_events?created_ats=2019-12-31T23:59:59Z,2020-07-04T12:00:00Z`

###### **Exception**
The `label_selector` query parameter will act as AND function, not an OR.

`GET /v3/spaces?label_selector=production,east_coast`

This will return all spaces whose metadata has labels with keys `production` AND `east_coast`.

##### **Combined filters**
`GET /v3/apps?names=the_name&stacks=cflinuxfs3`

This will return all apps with name `the_name` AND stack `cflinuxfs3`.

##### **Empty filters**

An empty filter (`/v3/resources?fields=`) can mean either empty string (`""`) or `NULL`, depending on the resource type.

`GET /v3/buildpacks?stacks=`

This will return all buildpacks with stack `NULL`.

`GET /v3/routes?hosts=hostname1,,hostname2`

This will return all routes with hostname `"hostname1"`, `""` OR `"hostname2"`.

#### Relational Operators (Experimental)

Some fields (e.g. `created_at` and `updated_at`) can be filtered using relational operators when listing resources.

For example, a response to `GET /v3/audit_events?created_ats[lt]=2020-06-30T12:34:56Z` will contain
audit events with a `created_at` timestamp strictly earlier than `2020-06-30T12:34:56Z`.

Multiple relational operators can be combined to further refine the listed resources. For example, a
response to `GET /v3/audit_events?created_ats[lt]=2020-01-02T00:00:00Z&created_ats[gt]=2019-12-31T23:59:59Z`
will return all audit events occurring on New Year's Day.

Timestamps must be in [standard timestamp format](#timestamps).

##### Valid relational operators

**Operator** | **Description**
-------------|-----------------
**lt**       | Return resources strictly less than the given value for the filtered attribute
**lte**      | Return resources less than or equal to the given value for the filtered attribute
**gt**       | Return resources strictly greater than the given value for the filtered attribute
**gte**      | Return resources greater than or equal to the given value for the filtered attribute

#### Exclusion Operator (Experimental)

Some fields support filtering on all values except a given set of values.

For example, a response to `GET /v3/audit_events?target_guids[not]=guid-1,guid-2`
will contain audit events with a `target.guid` not equal to `guid-1` nor `guid-2`.

**Operator** | **Description**
-------------|-----------------
**not**      | Return resources not equal to the given value(s) for the filtered attribute
