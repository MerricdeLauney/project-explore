<%= yield_content :staging_security_group_spaces %>
```

This endpoint binds one or more spaces to a security group with the staging lifecycle.

Staging app containers within these spaces will inherit the rules specified by this security group.

Apps within these spaces must be restaged for these changes to take effect.

Unless a security group is globally-enabled, an admin must add it to a space for it to be visible for the org and space managers. Once it's visible, org and space managers can add it to additional spaces.
