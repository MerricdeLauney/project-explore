## Domains

Domains represent a [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) that is used for application routes.

A domain can be scoped to an organization, meaning it can be used to create routes for spaces inside that organization, or be left unscoped to allow all organizations access.
