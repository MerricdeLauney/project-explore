## Audit Events

Audit events help Cloud Foundry operators monitor actions taken against resources (such as apps) via user or system actions.

For more information and a list of all possible event types, see the [Cloud Foundry docs](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/running/managing-cf/audit-events.html).
