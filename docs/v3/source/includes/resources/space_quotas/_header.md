## Space Quotas

Space quotas are named sets of quotas. Space quota names are unique within an organization. For example, an organization may only have one space quota named "production", but two organizations may have two distinct space quotas, both named "production".

Only one space quota may be applied to a given space at any given time.

Space quotas cannot be used to bypass organization quotas. When the organization's quota and the space's quota specify a different values for a given resource, the more restrictive of the two is used. In the event of permissions, the more restrictive permission is used.
