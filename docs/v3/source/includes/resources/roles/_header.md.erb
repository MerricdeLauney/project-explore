## Roles

Roles control access to resources in organizations and spaces.
Roles are assigned to users.

For example, a user with the `space_developer` role is able to push
applications to their space. A `space_manager` user can also add roles to users
within that space (e.g. making a user a `space_auditor`). An
`organization_manager` has wide-reaching privileges, able to create & delete
spaces, and assign & unassign roles to users.
