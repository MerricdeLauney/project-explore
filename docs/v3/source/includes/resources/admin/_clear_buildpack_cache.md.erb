This endpoint will delete all of the existing buildpack caches in the
blobstore. The buildpack cache is used during staging by buildpacks as a way to
cache certain resources, e.g. downloaded Ruby gems. An admin who wants to
decrease the size of their blobstore could use this endpoint to delete
unnecessary blobs.
