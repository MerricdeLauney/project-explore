### Visibility of service offerings

This table shows the service offerings that different roles can see.
The service offerings that a user can see relate to their space and organization roles,
regardless of which space or organization is being targeted.

A service offering can be seen when at least one of its service plans can be seen.
Service plans may be configured to be `public`,
or they may be configured with a relationship to a restricted list of organizations.

Service offerings and service plans from a space-scoped service broker cannot have their visibility configured.
They are only visible to members of that space.
