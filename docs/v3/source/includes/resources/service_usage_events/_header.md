## Service Usage Events

Service usage events are a record of changes in the usage of services. For
example, service usage events are recorded when a service instance is created,
updated, and deleted. They may contain information about the service instance in
question and the associated space, service broker, and service offering.

Usage events are typically used by billing and chargeback applications.
