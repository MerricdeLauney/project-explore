## Space Features

Space features are used to manage whether optional capabilities are enabled for
a given space.

Currently, the only space feature is SSH (`ssh`), which controls whether
applications in the space may be accessed via SSH.

**Note**: SSH must also be [enabled globally](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/running/config-ssh.html) and on the [app](#supported-app-features).
