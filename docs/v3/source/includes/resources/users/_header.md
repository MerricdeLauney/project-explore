## Users

Every Cloud Foundry action (pushing an application, creating a space) requires a
user. Each Cloud Foundry installation has one pre-installed user, admin, which
can create subsequent users. Users can be assigned roles which give them
privileges to perform actions. For example, the Space Developer role grants a
user permission to manage apps and services in a space (to push apps, scale
apps, delete apps).
