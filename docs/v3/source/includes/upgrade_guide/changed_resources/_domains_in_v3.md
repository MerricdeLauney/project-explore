### Domains in V3

In V2, there were two types of domains exposed via different endpoints: private domains and shared domains.

In V3, there is only one domain resource. A domain is "shared" if it has an "owning organization", which is the organization in which the domain is accessible. This is represented as a relationship to this organization. A domain is "private" if it doesn't have this relationship.
