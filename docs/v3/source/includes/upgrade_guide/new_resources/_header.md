## New Resources

The V3 API introduces new resources that are not available on the V2 API. Below are brief descriptions of these resources. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list and may not be updated as new resources are added to V3.

**Note:** Some of these resources may still be experimental and are subject to change or removal without warning. For up to date information on which resources are still experimental see [Experimental Resources](#experimental-resources).
